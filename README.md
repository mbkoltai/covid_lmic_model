## Model fitting satellite-based excess mortality data in Mogadishu, Somalia

**repo under construction/cleanup**

This repo contains scripts to run model fitting and to extract and visualise the results of fits. The scripts are accompanying [this preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/) (to be uploaded).
To run simulations you need to download the age-structured compartmental COVID19 model CovidM; available in several repos, for instance [here](https://github.com/nicholasdavies/newcovid/tree/master/covidm_for_fitting).

Dear Mihaly
It was very sunny today, apparently. I managed to complete my part of the analysis. My suggestion would be that you run the control_code script on Github, which will generate all the dataset and figures you might need. However, please see attached for the most essential output dataset, which also now contains two alternative population estimates (one forward-calculating from 2015, and the other back-calculating from 2020; the 2015 and 2020 point estimate sources are from the same project, WorldPop).

All the files named ‘out…’ are generated from the script.

For the ‘true’ baseline crude death rate, I’ve gone for a range from 0.20 to 0.60 with interval 0.05, and assumed that each value in that range was the value on 1 Jan 2017 (start of analysis period).

I also had a look at whether surface area per grave changes over time (attached figure). Doesn’t seem to, but it’s hard to know with so few data points…

I am going to write up my part of the report this evening and will forward that as well.

Let me know if you have any questions!
